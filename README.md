# Switchboard

Companion app for the AFRC Connecting the Network guide

## About the App

Switchboard is a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile application designed
to be a companion resource to the Connecting the Network Guide produced by
AFRC/A1Z.

### Why the name Switchboard

The name Switchboard refers to the nostalgic time where telephone companies
employed switchboard operators to connect callers to the world. Using this
analogy, the Switchboard app connects users to a plethora of resilience resources
around the Wing, AFRC, Air Force, Dod, and National agencies and organizations.
